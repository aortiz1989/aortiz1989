### Hi there, my name is Alex 👋

## ❗Introduction
I currently live in San Diego with my wife and two kids.  I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering from CSULB, an M.S. in Systems Engineering from USC, and I am a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).  I started my career at Boeing as an intern on the C-17 program.  I worked at Boeing for 6 years, working IT related roles.  In 2016, I moved over to Northrop Grumman where I continued my IT journey.  In 2018, I was given an opportunity to become a Technical Project Manager for Global Hawk.  Loved the job and later found an opportunity to become a Technical Program Manager for a leading autonomous robotics company in San Diego.  When I'm not working that full-time job, you can find my wife and I trying to launch very first company.  Check us out!  [Apetech LLC](https://apetech.me/)
